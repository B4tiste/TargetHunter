## How to play : 
### Requirements
Be sure to have `Ursina` installed, the render engine I used for this project by using :
> pip install ursina

Your goal is to catch as much red targets as you can, using the WASD key, you can change them to ZQSD for French people or anything you want, in this part of the `TargetHunter.py` code, by changing the letter in the [ ] :

```python
# WASD case :
	if held_keys['w']:#Go Up
		player.y = player.y + SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['a']:#Go to the Left
		player.x = player.x - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['s']:#Go Down
		player.y = player.y - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['d']:#Go to the Right
		player.x = player.x + SPEED * time.dt
```

You can use the `ESCAPE` key to acces the Game Menu, and press `SPACE` to restart a game.

You can use the `L` key to close and leave the Game.

### Bonus and Penalty
Be careful, each time you hit a target, your speed increases and you'll gain 1 point, but if you touch a wall, you'll be slower, and you'll lose a point !

You can also catch a Bonus, wich is represented by a magenta square flying around during the game. This bonus will give you 5 extra seconds to play the game and try to catch as much targets as you can !

### Game Settings
The default time of a game is 30s, wich depends of the refresh rate of your computer screen, but you can modify the value of your screen refresh rate in this part of the code to fit your needs :

**/!\ Change this value according to your screen refresh rate : **

```python
#Refresh Rate value : 60hz
REFRESH_RATE = 60
```

You can change the duration of a game in this part of the code

```python
#Duration of a game : 30s
GAME_TIME = 30
```
