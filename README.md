# TargetHunter

A little 2D game where you have to hunt red targets, while your speed is increasing and decreasing as things progress, with a score saving system

Be sure to check all the information below before playing 


## How to play : 
### Requirements
Be sure to have `Ursina` installed, the render engine I used for this project by using :
> pip install ursina

Your goal is to catch as much red targets as you can, using the WASD key, you can change them to ZQSD for French people or anything you want, in this part of the `TargetHunter.py` code, by changing the letter in the [ ] :

```python
# WASD case :
	if held_keys['w']:#Go Up
		player.y = player.y + SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['a']:#Go to the Left
		player.x = player.x - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['s']:#Go Down
		player.y = player.y - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['d']:#Go to the Right
		player.x = player.x + SPEED * time.dt
```

Be careful, each time you hit a target, your speed increases and you'll gain 1 point, but if you touch a wall, you'll be slower, and you'll lose a point !

The default time of a game is 30s, but you can modify this value in this part of the code to fit your needs (l.25):

**/!\ Change this value according to your screen refresh rate :  /!\\**

```python
#Refresh Rate value
REFRESH_RATE = 60
```

You can change the duration of a game in this part of the code

```python
#Duration of a game : 30s
rem_time = 30
```

Using `Ursina` engine in `Python`
